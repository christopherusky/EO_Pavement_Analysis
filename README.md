Step 1. Create Layers. 
This creates the layers required for your project, these are:

Road Centre Lines - vector file for the road centre lines along which the sample grid will create the bounding boxes
Sample Grid - the layer in which for each class of road condition the bounding boxes are created
Source Raster - the virtual raster from which the sample grid will use each feature to clip the raster
Clipped Rasters - the resuling clipped rasters.

Step 2.

Step 5. Raster extracts to file. 
The on button click will ask you to specify where you want to save the extacts.
Once running the progress bar will update as it processes each raster extract. It does this one file at a time as I found on a machine with limited resources it was taking too long and running hot.
